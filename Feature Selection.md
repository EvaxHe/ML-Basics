Feature Selection is different from Dimensionality Reduction 

**Feature Selection:** Select a subset of input features from the dataset.
* Unsupervised: Do not use the target variable (e.g. remove redundant variables).
  * Correlation
* Supervised: Use the target variable (e.g. remove irrelevant variables).
  * Wrapper: Search for well-performing subsets of features.
  * RFE
* Filter: Select subsets of features based on their relationship with the target.
  * Statistical Methods
  * Feature Importance Methods
* Intrinsic: Algorithms that perform automatic feature selection during training.
  * Decision Trees
  * Add Regularization methods 

**Dimensionality Reduction:** Project input data into a lower-dimensional feature space.
